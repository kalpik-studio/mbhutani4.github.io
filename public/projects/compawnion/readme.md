## The Application

A Mobile based platform through which the dog lovers who unfortunately can’t afford one could spend time with them. The dog lovers could help in care, handling of these dogs by booking time slots. They could even provide holiday homes. As we know that dogs are the most friendly creatures on earth this service could be used for helping friends.

## My Role

I designed the mobile based platform along with a website which was used by customers for registeration for the services by paying a minimal subscription fee. The designs were user friendly and attractive. The prototype was designed for user testing. On the business front, the business model canvas was designed for the investors to understand the services.

## The Challenge

Thinking of an innovative business idea to provide services to users by resolving one of their daily life problems. We as group wanted to provide comfort to provide comfort and relaxation to the users from their daily hassle.

The surveys and interviews conducted in Sweden depicted how the users consider dogs as a part of their family but still due to their busy work schedule they are unable to spend time with their dogs. The team decided to provide healthy environment both to those lonely dogs and people craving to spend time with these friendly creatures but unfortunately cannot afford one.

## The Approach

In the research phase of the project, surveys and interviews were conducted with different dog owners to know their opinion and perspective about sharing their dogs with other. Some interviews were conducted with Veterinaries as well to know their opinion of having one such community. It was found that people were willing to share their dogs as being alone at home makes them dull and feel lonely.

After receiving a positive response from dog owners and veterinarian, few dog trainers were consulted to have deep knowledge about the dogs, training available for the dogs, different breeds etc. Observing gathered information, another round of survey and interviews was conducted with people willing and desperate to spend time with these dogs or the ones who wants to own one of their own anytime in future.
