# DELTA

## The Application

A mobile based platform where residents can engage with their community and can either benefit from it or help the other residents in their day-to-day work like renting them seldom used commodities, help them move, provide professional help with software help etc. The users can subscribe to the categories they can provide help and feedback for the same will be provided.

## The Challenge

Creating a design vision of a service , interface, object, intended to support the idea of utilizing or consuming local resources rather than global resources, in a sustainable and environmentally efficient manner.

## Problem Statement

The residents of the same housing communities are not familiar with each other and they require assistance in their day-to-day work and they ask help from other residents for the same.

## Personas and Scenarios

The interviews and surveys were conducted to find the opinion, ideas and similarities required for design. This gave a clear view of what user expects or understands from the design vision.
